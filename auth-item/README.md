# Auth & Item Management Assignments

This folder contains three versions of the same assignment  
— building an authentication and item management system —   
using different tech stacks with Javascript.

## Project Structure
- **express-api/**: Express.js + in-memory storage.
- **react-express/**: React frontend + Express backend.
- **nextjs/**: Fullstack Next.js implementation.

## Common Features
- Signup / Signin (JWT-based)
- Item CRUD (owner-restricted)
- Input validation using Zod
- Password hashing (bcrypt)
- Token-based authorization (middleware)

## Goal
To demonstrate understanding of fullstack patterns
by re-implementing the same system with different architectures.

## Next Steps
[REFLECTION.md](./REFLECTION.md) for analysis and learning notes.
